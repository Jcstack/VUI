# vui
Yet a really simple and impressive UI framework for **SavJS** .

## Get Started

```
npm install @vui/core --save
```

## Design Philosophy

- Minimize rule, and all components are split as much as possible .
- Modifier rule, mainly used for the appearance control of components, refer to [Bulma](http://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/syntax/)
- A simple reset, basically only a box model .
- Attention to the component structure prototype, it just defines the basic representation, and styling by the modifier .
