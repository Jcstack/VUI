Vue UI components for **SavJS**

## Get Started

Checkout the source code then ...

```
npm install
```

## Design Philosophy

- Minimize rule, and all components are split as much as possible .
- Modifier rule, mainly used for the appearance control of components, refer to [Bulma](http://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/syntax/)
- A simple reset, basically only a box model .
- Strict z-index level control, refer to [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) .
- Attention to the component structure prototype, it just defines the basic representation, and styling by the modifier .
